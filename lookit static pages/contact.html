        			<p>To report any technical difficulties during participation, please contact our team by email at <a href="mailto:lookit-tech@mit.edu">lookit-tech@mit.edu</a>.</p>
        			<h3>Questions about the studies</h3>
        			<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the studies, please first check our FAQ. With any additional questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:lookit@mit.edu">lookit@mit.edu</a>.</p>
        			<h3>For researchers</h3>
        			<p>We are committed to making Lookit into a tool for all developmental researchers and to keeping the code open-source. You can view the current <a href="https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api" target="_blank">Lookit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer" target="_blank">experiment player</a> codebases on Github, and check out the issues to learn about current and planned development. Documentation about using and contributing to Lookit is available <a href="http://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">here</a>.Several initial test studies of a prototype Lookit platform were completed in 2015; you can read about the results, and strengths and limitations of the platform, in <a href='http://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/opmi/1/1'>these papers</a>.</p>
        			<p>We're not quite ready to start hosting additional studies from other labs yet, but our plan is to open the platform up to everyone! Although we aim for Lookit to be as accessible as possible, some familiarity with programming basics will be helpful for researchers. An ideal skillset for creating your own studies would include basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for study creation; passing familiarity with the <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.8.0/" target="_blank">Ember framework</a> used in the frameplayer; and Python for data processing.</p>
        			<p>Eager to use Lookit for your own research, or want to help make it available sooner? Please check out  <a href="https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/wiki" target="_blank">researcher wiki</a> to learn more about the current status of the project and how you can get involved.
