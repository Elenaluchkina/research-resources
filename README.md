# research-resources

A home for files and resources that may be of use to researchers using Lookit. When you create training materials, recruitment materials, IRB protocols, stock photos for positioning, training videos that might be useful examples, etc. please reach out on Slack and we'll add them here! 

This was previously the home of the Lookit Wiki, but the information there has been moved to the main [docs](https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) to make everything easier to find.
